//Variables: The :root selector defines global CSS variables (--yelcol, --white, --letterSpacing) that can be reused throughout your CSS for consistent styling.
//Ease of Maintenance: If you decide to change the letter spacing (e.g., to 2px), you only have to update it in one place (the :root section), and it will reflect everywhere you've used that variable.
//Consistency: Using variables helps maintain consistent styling across your application, making it easier to manage design systems.
//Reusability: If you need to use the same letter spacing (or any style) in multiple places, using a variable can help you avoid repetition.
